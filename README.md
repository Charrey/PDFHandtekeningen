# PDFHandtekeningen
A simple program that automates placing signatures in PDF files.

## To use this:
1. Collect the PDF files you want to place signatures in in a single folder (or don't if it's just one).
2. Make a signature file, such that the background is transparent.
3. Create a folder to output the edited PDF files to.
4. Open the GUI.
5. Select the input, signature file and output.
6. Select on which page of each PDF the signature line is located. (if this differs for each file, you have to run this program multiple times.)
7. Select whether this should be repeated. For example, if page 4 is selected and this is checked, the signature will also be placed on pages 8, 12 et cetera.
8. Choose how many pts from the left it should be (find this by trial and error)
9. Choose how many pts from the top it should be (find this by trial and error)
10. Click the button
